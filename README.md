# Webify 

Webify is an online web application developed in Django. It provides two different services to users which are URL Shortener and OCR.

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web that enables the Uniform Resource Locator to be made considerably shorter and still direct to the desired page. This is done by using a redirect path to a web page that has a long URL.

Optical character recognition or optical character reader is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.

This project is developed using Django for backend and HTML and CSS for frontend.
